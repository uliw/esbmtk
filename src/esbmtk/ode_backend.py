        r.lof > 0.  These require a flux statements and a reservoir
        equation.

        2) Species that do not have active fluxes but are computed
        as a tracer, i.e.. HCO3.  These only require a reservoir
        equation

        3) Species that do not change but are used as input.  Those
        should not happen in a well formed model, but we cannot
        exclude the possibility.  In this case, there is no flux
        equation, and we state that dR/dt = 0
