"""Test complex model calculations with isotopes.

Note, this is a copy of an early version of a 4 box
isotope model. It has not been tuned, and no attempt \
has been made to match them with observational values.
However,
they do serve as a benchmark and will detect if
numerical mistakes creep in.
